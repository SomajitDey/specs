                          Project: IPNS-Link
               Organization: https://github.com/ipns-link


IPNS-Link consists of an exposer app, henceforth referred to as Exposer, and a gateway,
henceforth referred to as Gateway. The Gateway merely acts as a smart proxy and does not
host anything by itself. Both the Exposer and the Gateway do not process user data except
the http request headers, and consequently, remain agnostic of the contents of the website(s)
being exposed and accessed using the IPNS-Link project. Therefore, the project cannot be held
liable for any violation caused by a website exposed using IPNS-Link.

The IPNS-Link project was conceived and is being maintained, with humanity's best interests
in mind - ranging from freedom of speech, self-expression and sharing of valuable information
under the Fair-Use policy (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html). The project is
not meant to be misused for copyright violation, illegal or criminal activities and blatantly
unethical acts.

The developer(s) and maintainer(s) will not be responsible or accountable for any harm caused
by the use of any component of IPNS-Link, Exposer or Gateway.
