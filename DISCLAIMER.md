# DISCLAIMER

[IPNS-Link](https://github.com/ipns-link) consists of an exposer app, henceforth referred to as **Exposer**, and a web-portal, henceforth referred to as **Gateway**. The Gateway merely acts as a smart proxy and **does not host** anything by itself. Both the Exposer and the Gateway **do not process any user data except the http request headers**, and therefore remain agnostic of the contents of the website(s) being exposed and accessed using IPNS-Link. 

IPNS-Link was conceived and is being maintained, with humanity's best interests in mind - ranging from freedom of speech, self-expression and sharing of valuable information under the [Fair-Use policy](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html). **It is not meant to be misused for copyright infringing, illegal or criminal activities and blatantly unethical acts**. On request, all public Gateway providers, following due diligence, **may block offensive sites** from being served through their respective Gateways.

The developer(s) and maintainer(s) of IPNS-Link **will not be responsible or accountable** for any harm caused by the use of any software from the [IPNS-Link organization](https://github.com/ipns-link).
